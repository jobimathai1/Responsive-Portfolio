      <p>Hi and welcome to my little corner on github. Yes, that's a real lion, and no its not sedated. He is only
          9 months old in this picture. His name is Luca and he currently resides in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. I visited
          him and his other friends in March 2018. If you are ever in Thailand, I would highly recommend visiting this
          <a href="http://www.safaripark-kan.com/eng/home.htm" target="_blank">sanctuary.</a></p>

      <p>I love to travel and enjoy just walking around in a city unknown to me. I would love to travel more and explore
          everything this planet has to offer.</p>

      <p>I currently work as a QA Engineer. I focus on API testing and other backend testing with a dash of frontend
          testing from time-to-time. I am in the process of learning and implementing what I am learning from UCLA
          Bootcamp to enhance my current position as QA Engineer.</p>
